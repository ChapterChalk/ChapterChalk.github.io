# Update Statements
# These statements are called whenever something changes or needs to be updated in the database. These all take the same general format, so I'll show a few examples. You just need to change the table, column names, and values.

# Changes to the book database. Called whenever author makes a change.
UPDATE book_database
SET photo = val1, author_summary = val2, ...
WHERE book_id = current_session_book_id;

# Changing the updated_date when a new chapter is published.
UPDATE book_database
SET updated_date = current_date
WHERE book_id = current_session_book_id;

# Author edits their chapter
UPDATE chapter_database
SET chapter_content = what_author_entered
WHERE chapter_id = current_session_chapter_id;

# User advances their progress in a book in their library
UPDATE user_library_database
SET progress_index = current_read_chapter (no += 1 in SQL so this will need to be done on the frontend :/)
WHERE book_id = current_book_id AND user_id = current_user_id;


# Delete statements
# We don't use these much, but they definitely exist. They also take a simple format.

# Author Deletes a tag
DELETE FROM tags_database WHERE book_id = session_book_id AND tag_string = what_user_entered;

# User removes a book from their library
DELETE FROM user_library_database WHERE book_id = session_book_id AND user_id = current_user_id;

# User deletes their review
DELETE FROM reviews_database WHERE book_id = session_book_id AND user_id = current_user_id;

# User deletes their comment
DELETE FROM comments_database WHERE chapter_id = session_chapter_id AND user_id = current_user_id;
